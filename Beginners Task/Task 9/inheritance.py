# Create inheritance using MobilePhone as base class and Apple &
# Samsung as child class
# 1. The base class should have properties:
# 1. ScreenType = Touch Screen
# 2. NetworkType = 4G/5G
# 3. DualSim = True or False
# 4. FrontCamera = (5MP/8MP/12MP/16MP)
# 5. rearCamera = (8MP/12MP/16MP/32MP/48MP)
# 6. RAM = (2GB/3GB/4GB)
# 7. Storage = (16GB/32GB/64GB)
# 2. Create basic mobile phone functionalities in the classes like:
# make_call, recieve_call, take_a_picture, etc.
# 3. Use super() constructor for calling parent classâ€™s constructor
# 4. Make some objects of Apple class with different properties
# 5. Make some objects of Samsung class with different properties
